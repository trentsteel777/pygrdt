Notes from red notepad 18/7/17

redis and memcached as caching layer (perhaps for strategy results)

When scraping data try to find stock specific table otherwise fall back to generic option table

celery workers can be written in pure c - interoperating with c by using librabbitmq-c. Celery workers can also be written in c by calling the c code by extending python (python extended methods). Might now have to do this straight away if using PyOpenCL.

There should be two databases, one on each odroid. One production database and the other a backup database for fall back/ recovery.

Add proper names on the tables. Not 'analysisportal_option'
