#Create installation directories
mkdir ~/venvs/

#cd ~/venvs/ and download project from github
git clone https://github.com/trentsteel777/pygrdt.git

#Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv pygrdt

#Setup postgres database
see document 'pygrdt_database_config.txt' in docs folder

#Activate virtual environment
cd ~/venvs/pygrdt
source bin/activate

#Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

#Dependencies may be needed for:
#lxml
sudo apt-get install python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev python3-dev

#postgres
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev

#Run command to setup tables in database
python manage.py migrate

#Run the setup_pygrdt.py script to add some initial data to database
cd ~/venvs/pygrdt
source bin/activate
./manage.py shell < ~/venvs/pygrdt/initial_setup/setup_pygrdt.py

#Setup celery to run as a daemon (for some further info see HOWTO: Daemonize Celery)
1. copy init scripts to correct location in filesystem
# You may need to change the user and pygrdt installation location path
# in the /etc/default/celery* files if installation is different than default
cd ~/venvs/pygrdt/initial_setup/etc/default/
sudo cp celery* /etc/default/

cd ~/venvs/pygrdt/initial_setup/etc/init.d/
sudo cp celery* /etc/init.d/

2. Change ownership on run and log files to new pygrdt user otherwise there is a permission denied when trying to start the worker or beat
sudo chown -R odroid:odroid /var/log/celery/
sudo chown -R odroid:odroid /var/run/celery/

3. Add celeryd and celerybeat to run on startup
sudo update-rc.d celerybeat defaults
sudo update-rc.d celeryd defaults

# Start celeryd and celerybeat to begin scraping prices from the nasdaq website
sudo /etc/init.d/celeryd start
sudo /etc/init.d/celerybeat start

# Run django server so it is accessible from home lan. Replace ip 192.168.1.8 as appropriate.
python manage.py runserver 192.168.1.8:8000

#If you setup a rule on your router you can give the address 192.168.1.8 a domain name.
# for example odroid. This means that you can access django from other computers on your home network
# by odroid1:8000/grdt

#If you have ubuntu installed and you don't want to run the gui on startup then:
#Ref: https://superuser.com/questions/1106174/boot-ubuntu-16-04-into-command-line-do-not-start-gui
# Find display manager
cat /etc/X11/default-display-manager

# Disable GUI on startup
sudo systemctl disable lightdm.service

# To start GUI from command line:
sudo systemctl start lightdm.service

# Make sure rabbitmq is installed on the host and configured (replace "myuser" as appropriate).
# PYGRDT uses what's below as is (i.e. No changes were made to below commands).
# The below configuration is reflected in the rabbitmq url that is in the settings.py file.
