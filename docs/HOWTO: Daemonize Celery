1. init scripts
copy files from https://github.com/celery/celery/tree/master/extra/generic-init.d into /etc/init.d/ using sudo

2. create blank config files
sudo touch /etc/default/celeryd
sudo touch /etc/default/celerybeat

3. populate config files
Copy examples from http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/daemonizing.html and change directories as needed

Note: the user you run celery as needs to be able to access the read
and write places of your app. So if your app is in another user's home directory
the setup won't work

4. create celery user and group (if not already added)
sudo adduser celery
# password -> celery

5. Change ownership on run and log files to new celery user otherwise there is a permission denied when trying to start the worker or beat
sudo chown -R celery:celery /var/log/celery/
sudo chown -R celery:celery /var/run/celery/

sudo chown -R trent:trent /var/log/celery/
sudo chown -R trent:trent /var/run/celery/

6. Make init.d scripts executable
sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/celerybeat
sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/celeryd

7. start/ stop celery worker/beat using:
sudo /etc/init.d/celeryd start
sudo /etc/init.d/celeryd stop
sudo /etc/init.d/celeryd restart

sudo /etc/init.d/celerybeat start
sudo /etc/init.d/celerybeat stop
sudo /etc/init.d/celerybeat restart
