#Step 1 - If external hard drive is a FAT filesystem you want be able to maintain permissions in this hard drive.
# You may want to reformat the harddrive (you will lose all data), otherwise skip to step 2.

# What was recommended was to reformat to filesystem type ext4. This will maintain permissions when copying from linux to there.
# However, supposedly it is not as compatible with windows as FAT.

#Ref: https://askubuntu.com/questions/549078/format-external-hard-drive-to-ext4-in-command-line
# Make sure /dev/sda1 is in fact the external harddrive before reformatting it! To do this you can use: sudo fdisk -l
sudo umount /dev/sda1
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1

#Now the external harddrive has been reformatted you can give it a name
sudo e2label /dev/sda1 grdt_db_hd

#Step 2 - Move the database

#Find where databases are installed
#Ref: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-move-a-postgresql-data-directory-to-a-new-location-on-ubuntu-16-04
sudo -u postgres psql
SHOW data_directory;

# dir to move:
/var/lib/postgresql/9.5/main

# shutdown postgressql before making the move AND verify the shutdown was a success
sudo systemctl stop postgresql
sudo systemctl status postgresql

#Using the -a flag preserves the permissions and other directory properties while -v provides verbose output so you can follow the progress.
# Starting the rysnc from postgresql folder mimics the original directory structure in new location.
# Using -a will retain ownership by PostgresSQL user so permissions problems are avoided in future upgrades

sudo rsync -av /var/lib/postgresql /media/odroid/grdt_db_hd/

# Rename the original folder until you can confirm the rsync was a success
sudo mv /var/lib/postgresql/9.5/main /var/lib/postgresql/9.5/main.bak

# Rename the postgres folder
sudo mv /var/lib/postgresql/ /var/lib/postgresql_old/

# Create symlink to the new location of the database
cd /var/lib/
sudo ln -s /media/odroid/grdt_db_hd/postgresql /var/lib/postgresql

# Add appropriate permissions so the postgres user has access to the new location of the database
#https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/285080/psql-could-not-connect-to-server-no-such-file-or-directory
sudo chown -R postgres:postgres /var/lib/postgresql/
sudo chmod -R u=rwX,go= /var/lib/postgresql/

# Check changes were a success
sudo systemctl start postgresql
sudo systemctl status postgresql
sudo -u postgres psql
